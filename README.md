## Outline <a name="Outline"></a>

-This project is a simple 2D game created in p5.js and Javascript for the frontend, and Arduino for the interaction with hardware. It is coded in Javascript, HTML, and the arduino language. In this game, you move a character using either the keyboard 
or the joystick on the arduino. The player must avoid obstacles and increase their score to win. The game also incorporates LED lights on the arduino to display the amount of lives the player has remaining.

-The game is set in the streets of LSU. The player must navigate the streets as a small squirrel trying to avoid the orange scooter obstacles. The objective is to move forward as much as possible, with each step forward accounting for a point. The 
player can either move up, down, left, or right to help avoid obstacles. The player has 3 lives, each of which are represented by an LED light on the arduino. Each life lost will result in a LED turning off. The game ends when either all 3 lives or lost
or when the player reaches a score of 30.
